# Simple, Poorly Functioning KNN Classifier. 

It will train and test each time you run the code

example_knn.py - This code runs considering the full image without any processing. The KNN classifier acts only on the raw picture pixel intensity values. The resulting model achieves rather poor performance.

## Run

python knn.py

NOTE: set python2.7 as interpreter
